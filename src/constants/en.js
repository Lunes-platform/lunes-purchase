      <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
      <p>The Terms and Conditions (the “T&C”) apply to the buyer of the Lunes token
      (“LNS”) and future user of the Lunes Platform. You should carefully read the T&C, as well as the white paper of the Lunes project before participating in the Initial Coin Offering.</p>

      <h5>Applicability</h5>
      <p>The following T&C constitute the agreement (the “Agreement”) between Lunes Platform (hereinafter “Lunes” or the “Company”), and you (the “User”) with respect to
      the purchase of the Lunes Token and the future services offered through the Lunes Platform. By using our services, you are agreeing to be bound by the T&C in
      its latest version. You are aware that Lunes may change this T&C at any time. Your continued use of the Lunes Platform means that you accept any new or modified
      terms.</p>

      <h5>Services</h5>
      <p>Lunes is a platform which provides a set of decentralized solutions through blockchain.
      In an uncomplicated and affordable way, we will pulverize our technologies into the population. With real solutions for daily life, we deliver services and
      products ranging from payment processes and fundraising, to authenticity records.</p>

      <h5>The Lunes Token (LNS)</h5>
      <p>LNS does not have the legal qualification as a security. LNS is final and non-refundable. LNS is not a share and does not give any right to participate in the
      general meetings of Lunes. LNS will not have a particular usage outside the Lunes Platform. The purchase of LNS shall therefore not be done for speculative usage.</p>

      <p>LNS can be purchased during the Initial Coin Offering directly from the Company or after the ICO at the Company or exchanger.</p>

      <p>Any future User purchasing LNS expressly acknowledges and represents that she/he has carefully reviewed the T&C and fully understands the risks, costs and
      benefits associated with the purchase of this token as indicated in the T&C.</p>

      <h5>Knowledge required<h5>
      <p>A future User undertaking to purchase LNS in relation to the token sale,  should ensure that she/he understands and has significant experience of cryptocurrencies,
      blockchain systems and services, and that she/he fully understands the risks associated with the token sale as well as the mechanism related to the use of
      cryptocurrencies (incl. storage).</p>

      <p>Lunes shall not be responsible for any loss of LNS or situations making it impossible to access to LNS, which may result in any actions or omissions of the future
      User or any person undertaking to acquire LNS.</p>

      <h5>Risks</h5>
      <p>Acquiring LNS involves various risks, in particular that Lunes may not be able to launch its operations and develop its platform. Therefore, and prior to
      acquiring
      LNS, any future user should carefully consider the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring LNS within the Initial Coin Offering, and, if necessary, obtain
      independent advice in this regard. Any interested person who is not in the position to accept or to understand the risks associated with the Initial Coin
      Offering (incl. the risks related to the non- development of Lunes Platform and operations) or any other risks as indicated in the T&C, should not acquire
      LNS, at this stage or later.</p>

      <h5>Self-Acquisition</h5>
      <p>Lunes is allowed to acquire LNS from the market at market price as value disbursement method. The acquisition must be authorized by the Board of Directors,
      under
      the condition that no conflict of interests is identified. Through acquisition of LNS, Lunes is not allowed to perform operations such as manipulation of LNS
      market.</p>

      <h5>Important Disclaimer</h5>
      <p>The T&C shall not and cannot be considered as an invitation to enter into an investment. They do not constitute or relate in any way nor should they be
      considered
      as an offering of securities in any jurisdiction. The T&C do not include or contain any information or indication that might be considered as a recommendation
      or that might be used to base any investment decision. LNS is a utility token and is not intended to be used as an investment.</p>

      <p>Lunes will be an operative entity managing a platform and LNS is only a utility token. Therefore, Lunes is not a financial intermediary and is not
      required to obtain any authorization for anti-money laundering purposes.</p>

      <p>Acquiring LNS shall not grant any right or influence over Lunes’ organization and governance to the purchasers.</p>

      <p>Employees of Lunes are allowed to operate with LNS at market price if they are in knowledge of information that may modify the price of the token.</p>

      <p>Regulatory authorities are carefully scrutinizing businesses and operations associated to cryptocurrencies in the world. In that respect, regulatory measures,
      investigations or actions may impact Lunes’ business and even limit or prevent it from developing its operations in the future. Any person undertaking to acquire
      LNS must be aware that the Lunes business model and the T&C may change or need to be modified because of new regulatory and compliance requirements from any
      applicable laws in any jurisdictions. In such case, purchasers and any person undertaking to acquire LNS acknowledge and understand that neither Lunes nor any
      of its affiliates shall be held liable for any direct or indirect loss or damages caused by such changes.</p>

      <p>Lunes will do its best to launch its operations and develop the Lunes Platform. Any person undertaking to acquire LNS acknowledges and understands that Lunes does
      not provide any guarantee that it will manage to establish an operative platform and therefore it cannot guarantee that the LNS can be used for social trading on
      the platform. They acknowledge and understand therefore that Lunes (incl. its bodies and employees) assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss or damage
      that would result from or relate to the incapacity to use LNS, except in the case of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.</p>

      <h5>Intellectual Property Rights</h5>
      <p>To the extent that copyright or other intellectual property rights exist in the Lunes Platform, such as software, know-how, analysis or programs, those copyrights
      and other intellectual and industrial rights belong to Lunes.</p>

      <h5>Limitation of Liability</h5>
      <p>Lunes, as well as its officers, directors, agents, joint ventures, employees and suppliers, assumes no liability or responsibility for any loss arising out of or
      related to the use of the Lunes Platform or any technical, interruption or malfunction of the platform.</p>

      <p>The limitation of liability set out above shall not be applicable in the event that Lunes, or a Lunes-employee, has caused the damage by intentional misconduct or
      by gross negligence.</p>

      <h5>Severability</h5>
      <p>If any of the provisions of the T&C or of the Agreement are deemed to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and
      effect.</p>
